# Battleships

Battleships is a one-player Python terminal game, which is run on the Heroku terminal.

### Live version of Battleships project:

## How to play

Users play against the computer's board only, trying to guess the computer's randomly placed ships. 

* The user has 10 attempts to sink 5 ships.
* The user inputs their choice in the terminal with rows (1-5) and columns (A-E).
* When the user scores a hit, the board marks it with 'X'.
* If the user is unsuccessful, it is marked with '-'.


## Features

* Each ship takes up one space on the board.
* To give the user a higher chance of success, the board size is reduced to a 5 by 5 spaces size.
* If the user hits all ships before their 10 turns run out, or all of their turns are used up, the user is informed of the game's end and they may start again.
